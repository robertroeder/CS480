# PA04: Table / Object Loading Example

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a simple table model in blender and implement an object loader in our code. We were then to export our table model to a .obj file and load it in using our object loader.

## Running the program
Enter the build directory and type "make". Then enter the bin directory and run the Table executable. This will load the table.obj file in bin/assets/models with random coloring and make it spin in the center of the screen. There are two more .obj files in the models directory that can be tested. Just change the line in src/main.cpp that calls loadOBJ.

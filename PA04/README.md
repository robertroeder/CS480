# PA04: Table / Object Loading Example

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a simple table model in blender and implement an object loader in our code. We were then to export our table model to a .obj file and load it in using our object loader.

## Running the program
Enter the build directory and type "make". Then enter the bin directory and run the Table executable. This will load the table.obj file in bin/assets/models with random coloring and make it spin in the center of the screen. To load a custom object, run the Table executable with the path to your .obj file as a command line argument.
